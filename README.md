# RKO
Source for my RGH tool, for any other people who are starting out and need a little boost, you can do what I have already done. (As long as it is my code)

I wouldn't recommend copying and pasting everything, as you won't learn anything.

Thanks to these people for support/assist:
CicadaTheRetroLord - 
Godzilla - 
Mari

This is also just release 4, nothing else included.

If you want release 5, its here:
discord.io/acktool

I'm not gonna release 5's source since its just the same.

DLL's used:
JRPC.dll
XDevKit.dll
